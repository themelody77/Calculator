# Advanced Calculator  
This is a Python script that provides various mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), and solving linear equations.  

## Usage
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.  
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.  
  <pre><code>cd path/to/advanced-calculator</code></pre>  
Run the script by executing the following command:  
<pre><code>python calculator.py</code></pre>
The script will display the calculator menu with options from 1 to 10.  
Enter the corresponding number to select the desired operation.  
Follow the prompts to enter the required values for the chosen operation.  
The script will calculate and display the result.  
  
## Functionality
The advanced calculator supports the following operations:  
Add: Adds two numbers.  
Subtract: Subtracts the second number from the first number.  
Multiply Multiplies two numbers.  
Divide: Divides the first number by the second number.  
Square Root: Calculates the square root of a number.  
Sine: Calculates the sine of an angle in degrees.  
Cosine: Calculates the cosine of an angle in degrees.  
Tangent: Calculates the tangent of an angle in degrees.  
Solve Linear Equations: Solves a system of two linear equations with two variables.  
Exit: Exits the calculator.  
Note: For the trigonometric functions, the angles should be entered in degrees.  
## Example
Here's an example of how to use the advanced calculator:  
```bash
